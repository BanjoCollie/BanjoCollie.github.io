<p>I finished the first demo of my game, Remnants of a Shattered World. You can download it <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gof20p63yj72rzq/Shattered%20World%201.1.zip?dl=0">here!</a></p>

<a id="how-to-play" class="anchor" href="#how-to-play" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to play</h2>

<p>The goal of the game is to survive as many waves as possible. If you walk to the computer in the center of the starting area, you can interact with it using the E key. You have two options, you can call a merchant or start the next wave. Merchants let you buy new equipment, hire soldier to command, and heal you and your allies. When you press the next wave button, ships will arrive and drop off enemies. The number of enemies increases every wave. There is no end to the game, but after wave 43 the game stops getting harder. I haven't spent much time working on balancing, so it very well could be impossible to win. If you want to just test the game out, pressing the P key makes you unable to die and gives you a lot of money. </p>

<h3>
<a id="full-controls" class="anchor" href="#full-controls" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Full controls</h3>

<p>+WASD move up, left, down and right respectively.</p>

<p>+Hold right click to aim, the red lines show the potential paths that your bullet may take.</p>

<p>+Left click is attack, if you are aiming you fire your gun, otherwise you melee.</p>

<p>+Tapping shift will make your character take cover at the nearest cover point you are looking at (the small blue circles on some corners). Cover gives you a small aim boost (from balancing your gun) and your character will be harder to hit.
Moving in any direction will make you exit cover.</p>

<p>+E interacts with the object under the mouse cursor, which lets you open doors and look at inventories.</p>

<p>+Spacebar pauses the game. When paused, left click and drag to select friendly soldiers and right click to tell them to move. If you hold shift, you can add a series of orders to a que.</p>

<p>+Holding Ctrl lets you extend your view towards the mouse.</p>

<p>+I opens the inventory, which shows what you have equipped and what is in your ships cargo hold. When you buy items the go to the cargo hold first, so remember to equip them after.</p>

<p>+C opens the character menu. This shows your characters traits and stats. (These are not currently implemented)</p>

<p>+Esc closes any menus that are open, and also opens the escape menu.</p>

<p>+P gives you an extremely good gun and armor that makes you invincible. Use it to test out the game.</p>

<a id="development-plans" class="anchor" href="#development-plans" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Development plans</h2>

<p>I have been working on this game on and off for a few years now (even though it doesn't really show it). Because of this I have some pretty grand ideas for what the game will eventually become. The current game is a demo to see how well combat works, as well as trying out menus and interfaces. I plan on improving the menu's and UI, adding some more commands for your allies, as well as adding more troop and equipment variety.</p>

<h3>
<a id="further-goals" class="anchor" href="#further-goals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Further goals</h3>

<p>The current combat system is actually just one part of a larger plan I'm working on. The goal is to create a spaceship fighting game with a large focus on your crew. The gunfights that currently exist would only happen during boarding action, after you or your enemy have had your ship disabled. I plan on eventually adding ship to ship combat and having a variety of crew skills that are needed for managing your ship</p>

<h3>
<a id="long-term-plans" class="anchor" href="#long-term-plans" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Long term plans</h3>

<p>The long term goal of this game is to create a sandbox rpg. In essence, I want to be able to be the captain of a ship and be able to have any adventure I can think of. You gradually build up your crew, spaceship, and potentially even command a fleet. I think I could make a pretty fun game out of it eventually, but this is more wishful thinking than anything I hope to accomplish soon.</p>
